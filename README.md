# AuTexTification: Automatic Text Identification 🤖👩🏻

This is the README of the project for the _Natural Language Processing_ Course (Academic Year 2022/2023).

The dataset consists of short text passages that have either been written by a **human** or have been **generated automatically** by a Language Model.

We aim to detect which of the texts has been automatically generated by a language model (Task 1) and in that case also identifying the particular Language Model that generated the text (Task 2).

The project was carried out using _Python_.
